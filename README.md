> **Calculating Ram**:

When it comes to calculating the amount of ram you need for your Minecraft server, what is perhaps now one of the most important factors is the version that your Minecraft server is going to run on. More later versions of Minecraft are much more ram-intensive and this is outlined in the below charts we have created for you. Keep in mind, mods are usually more resource-intensive than plugins and you should therefore account for more ram. Regardless of version, modded servers should not run below 3-5 GB of ram and at least 9-10 GB of ram for 1.18 modded servers or versions closer to the latest versions of Minecraft Java.
Furthermore, for **Minecraft Bedrock Edition**, please utilize the “Java Minecraft Versions 1.13 and ABOVE” chart below.

- **Java Minecraft Versions 1.12 and BELOW:**<br>

| <span style="color:white">RAM</span> | <span style="color:white">PLAYERS</span> | <span style="color:white">PLUGINS/MODS</span> |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 3 GB | Up to 20 |Up to 30 |
| 5 GB | Up to 30 | Up to 60 |
| 8 GB | Up to 40 | Up to 100 |
| 10 GB | Up to 60 | Up to 120 |
| 12 GB | Up to 100 | Up to 150+ |
| 16 GB | Up to 150 | Up to 150+ |
| 24 GB | Up to 200+ | Up to 150+ |
| 32 GB | Up to 400+ | Up to 150+ |

Especially for versions such as 1.8, a server can go a long way when it comes to plugins/players for the amount of ram. Any version that is 1.12 and below will be very ram efficient, which is the complete opposite of 1.13+. We recommend that for 1.12 and below, you should also consider 1 GB of ram for every 5 GB of world storage. If your worlds are too big, you can reduce them without any loss by following the instructions we have written here ["Clear Your Server Without Any Loss"](https://dash.stozu.net/articles/clear-your-server-without-any-loss)

- **Java Minecraft Versions 1.13 and ABOVE:**

| <span style="color:white">RAM</span> | <span style="color:white">PLAYERS</span> | <span style="color:white">PLUGINS/MODS</span> |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 3 GB | Up to 5 | Up to 2 |
| 5 GB | Up to 10 | Up to 20 |
| 8 GB | Up to 20 | Up to 40 |
| 10 GB | Up to 35 | Up to 50 |
| 12 GB | Up to 40 | Up to 70 | 
| 16 GB | Up to 50 | Up to 100 |
| 24 GB | Up to 100 | Up to 125+ |
| 32 GB | Up to 200+ | Up to 125+ |

You will notice that the amount of players/plugins/mods has now decreased for our ram usages, this is because later versions of Minecraft are unfortunately much more ram intensive. We also would like you to know that we have some specific latest version recommendations:
- For 1.15-1.17 you should have a minimum of 5 GB of ram.
- For 1.18+ you should have a minimum of 8 GB of ram.

Not following these recommendations could put you at risk of experiencing some lag and resources being fully taken up. There are some servers that will run just fine below these but this is the general requirement and you should not think that your server will be fine. You should also consider 1 GB of ram for every 2 GB of world storage. ["Clear Your Server Without Any Loss"](https://dash.stozu.net/articles/clear-your-server-without-any-loss)

> **Other**:

We will go over some general recommendations for BungeeCord as well as upgrading/downgrading ram!

- **BungeeCord:**
| <span style="color:white">RAM</span> | <span style="color:white">PLAYERS</span> | <span style="color:white">PLUGINS</span> |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 0.5 to 1 GB | Up to 300+ | Up to 10 |
| 2 GB | Up to 500+ | Up to 20 |
| 3+ GB | Up to 500+ | Up to 30 |

BungeeCord is a proxy system, which means it simply routes players into the appropriate servers connected to it. Unless you are running a network of over 400 players, up to 1 GB of ram is enough for BungeeCord. Then, you should account for plugins, if you’re using lots of BungeeCord plugins then a little more ram won’t hurt.

**Bedrock**:

For Minecraft Bedrock Edition, follow the “Java Minecraft Versions 1.13 and ABOVE” chart that is above will work. You can squeeze in some more plugins/players though per ram plans.

### *We do not restrict Player Slots, World Size, or Plugins/Mods. The chart above is only what we recommend.
